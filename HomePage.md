*Quote from Michael about being at the center of human innovation* <br />

My name is Matthieu Tapolsky and I am a new hire here at Dell Technologies. When I tell people that I work for Dell I often get a small glimmer of understanding or a questioning look and the follow up "Adele? Like the singer?" and I have to explain "No, Dell Technologies, the laptop company". Everytime I say that though, I realize that I am shortselling the company I work for because like Michael said, we are at the center of human innovation. Hopefully by perusing through this website you can see that Dell is not just "the laptop company" but in reality is a company with many offerings that is driving human progress. <br />

# Can include other small things like this from other people it was just an idea
