Derek Valentine is a Regional Sales Director for Secureworks for their Account Management Central region. He also serves as Chapter Founder/President of the Dell Technologies Black Networking Alliance Atlanta Chapter. 
 
“My mission is to support Dell’s 2030 Progress Made Real Goals around Diversity & Inclusion.  I’m an alumni of Clark Atlanta University and I enjoy leading the BNA chapter, as the founding President, in support of Project Immersion programs such as Cybersecurity and Professional Development workshops.  We are making an impact by equipping diverse talent at the Atlanta University Center with the tools needed to succeed in the future workforce at Dell and other companies.”

Derek also helped to establish a “Women of Dell” Panel which gave the young women at Spelman College a glimpse of the careers that are available within the Tech field but also Dell Technologies in general.  Derek is also a firm believer in trying to elevate and advance current Black Professionals at Dell Technologies.  The Professional Development programs and Networking initiatives of their BNA Atlanta chapter has helped several members to secure promotions within Dell Technologies and helped members to secure opportunities within other Dell Family Business units.

##### Student Testimonials
“I truly enjoyed the cybersecurity course and the time, energy, and resources that Dell poured into us students during the semester. I have learned so much about cyber risk, Dell technologies, and professionalism. I absolutely believe I left with many tools that I can use as a graduate starting my career.” - Ayanna Aziz, Spelman College
 
“I enjoyed everything that you all provided for us in the AUC. I obtained my full time job as a Pre-Sales Engineer after first learning about the role in the Sales Engineering course last semester. You all are really making an impact on us students at HBCU’s and especially in the AUC.” - Hassan Thomas, Morehouse College
 
“ I want to give a deep, long, and heartwarming thank you to Dell Technologies for awarding me the scholarship. All of you are deeply appreciated. It was much needed during this time. Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to connect, mentor, and teach my Spelman and Morehouse peers and I. I appreciate all of the topics you taught. I found them to be very helpful and needed. I sent you all LinkedIn requests. My current resume is attached below. I am interested in working for Dell Technologies post-graduation.” - Jocelyn Reynolds, Spelman College
