## Employee Resource Groups
Employee Resource Groups, or ERG's are programs within Dell Technologies that allow you to meet people that are interested or affected by similar things as you. The ERG's include Black Networking ALliance, Pride, Mosaic, Women in Action, Latino Connection and more. These offer a place for everyone to meet others who are also interested in learning more and do activites together in your region to meet people like you or who are interested in the same thing. You should note that you do not have to be LGBTQ+ to be in Pride, you just have to believe that it is a good cause like with all the other groups.

Could do a small subsection about each of the ERG's; wasn't sure exactly what the goal for this page was.
