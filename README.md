# D_I_Project
Diversity and Inclusion Project

This can be the instruction page on how to do everything. Welcome to GitHub; if you've never used it before think of it basically as a way to see the changes you make to your code(our website) almost immediately on the website.

If you want to make a change, in the top right corner of this box you should see a pen icon. Click that, and you will be able to edit text as easily as on a word document. When you have made your change, you scroll down, add a brief description (When writing this mine will be "Wrote Introdcutory Steps") and then click "Commit changes"

They will show up on the website within a few minutes and you can see your work!

Hopefully this helps and we can go into more depth later on if needed.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Matthieu98/D_I_Project/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Matthieu98/D_I_Project/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
