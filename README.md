# D_I_Project
Diversity and Inclusion Project

This can be the instruction page on how to do everything. Welcome to GitHub; if you've never used it before think of it basically as a way to see the changes you make to your code(our website) almost immediately on the website.

If you want to make a change, in the top right corner of this box you should see a pen icon. Click that, and you will be able to edit text as easily as on a word document. When you have made your change, you scroll down, add a brief description (When writing this mine will be "Wrote Introdcutory Steps") and then click "Commit changes"

They will show up on the website within a few minutes and you can see your work!

Hopefully this helps and we can go into more depth later on if needed.
